### 🔹 Transient Stability Analysis of Single Machine Infinite Bus (SMIB)
- Simulates a synchronous generator connected to an infinite bus.  
- Analyzes rotor angle, speed deviation, and power flow under disturbances.  
- Useful for power system stability and dynamic performance studies.

### 🔹 Three-Area Load Frequency Control (LFC) with Integral Control
- Models a three-area interconnected system with integral action.  
- Minimizes steady-state frequency error and improves dynamic response.  
- Demonstrates tie-line power exchange and inter-area coordination.
